    Welcome to the **LinkedIn User Prediction App**! This app uses a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual is a LinkedIn user based on a set of characteristics.  
    Simply choose the characteristics of a person, and the app will predict if they are likely to be a LinkedIn user, along with the probability of their usage.
